This project is a Hotel Rating System built using microservices architecture, where three main services - Users, Hotels, and Models - communicate with each other. The primary goal of this system is to allow users to rate hotels and provide valuable feedback. To ensure the system's reliability and robustness, various fault tolerance mechanisms have been implemented, including retry, circuit breaker, and rate limiter. Additionally, the project incorporates an API Gateway and a Service Registry through Eureka Server for efficient service communication and management.
